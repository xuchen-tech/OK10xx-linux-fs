  Usage: dpdk-version.sh

  Locate the rte_version.h file and parse out the version information.

  If RTE_SDK is set, then it is used to locate the file. If the
  RTE_SDK variable is not set then the current working directory
  is used.

  The default output of the version is 'DPDK Version: YY.MM.MINOR'
	e.g. 'dpdk-version.sh' gives 'DPDK Version: 17.08.0'

  Options: Only one option can be used at a time, the only exception
           is the '-v' option which must be first followed by any
           other option.

  '-h' prints usage messages

  '-v' print out the location of the file used, must be first option
    e.g. 'dpdk-version.sh -v -l' gives file path plus '-l' output.

  '-l' prints out the full version string
	e.g. 'dpdk-version.sh -l' gives 'DPDK-17.08.0-rc0'

  '-s' prints a shorter version string 
	e.g. 'dpdk-version.sh -s' gives '17.08.0'

  '-yy' prints the year number
  '-mm' prints the month number
  '-mi' prints the minor number
  '-rc' prints the suffix string

  '-m' prints out information is comma delimited format.
	e.g. 'dpdk-version.sh -m' give 'DPDK,17,08,0,-rc0'

  '-p' prints out a Python readable format of the version.
	e.g. 'dpdk-version.sh -m' gives

	version = {
		'prefix': 'DPDK',
		'year': '17',
		'month': '08',
		'minor': '0',
		'suffix': '-rc'
	}
