 3 Currently aiopt_lib handler for commands are not returning structured data.
   This would make it difficult to write wrapper applications over it. To be
   re-structured
 6 Some structures, typically aiopt_conf and aiopt_obj, have redundant or
   repeated members. Synchronization across them required.
10 Version check against valid/applicable MC
12 Multiple flag variables are being used in struct global_args - this is space
   wastage and can be compressed into a single 32bit integer with bit operations
13 Various members of struct global_args are static arrays - this should be
   improved. Current rationale: AIOP Tool is a run-to-completion tool and hence
   existing of such structure in memory is only limited to time required to
   complete a single command (which is couple of seconds only).
