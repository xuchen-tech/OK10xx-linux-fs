Introduction
===========================================
This file contains instructions for running the app_process_packet demo.
This demo shows an "autonomous" packet flow through the AIOP and illustrates the following:
1. MC initialization
2. MC DP object creation from a layout file
3. AIOP initialization
4. AIOP object discovery
5. Packet injection (from a PCAP file)
6. Packet modification within the AIOP - reflection (Flip the MAC and IP source and destination addresses)
7. Packet transmission from the AIOP (to a PCAP file)

===========================================
Setup
===========================================
1. Install Code Warrior (see Release Note for the compatible CW version).
2. Download the linux version of the simulator (see Release Note for the compatible LS_SIM version).
3. Copy the files ls2085a_sim_init_params.cfg and ls2085a_sys_test.cfg
   from the source tree at: aiopsl/build/aiop_sim/sim_files.
   into the simulator folder at: dtsim_release/linux64/
4. Update the “LD_LIBRARY_PATH” variable to point to the simulator folder.
   setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH {$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/user/LS_SIM_<version>/dtsim_release/linux64
5. Copy the layout file (dpl.dtb) from aiopsl/misc/setup/ to the simulator folder.
6. Copy “eth_ipv4_udp.pcap” from the source tree at: aiopsl/misc/setup/ into the simulator folder

===========================================
Execution flow
===========================================
1. Import the MC and AIOP projects into CodeWarrior:
   mc/build/mc_t4ls_sim/mc_app/.project
   aiopsl/build/aiop_sim/apps/app_process_packet/.project
2. Build both projects in CW.
3. Copy the resulting ELF file from the build project folder(aiop_app.elf)
   to the simulator folder (same location as cfg files).
4. Run the simulator:
   ./ccssim2 -port 42333
             -imodel "ls_sim_init_file=ls2085a_sim_init_params.cfg"
             -smodel "ls_sim_config_file=ls2085a_sys_test.cfg"
5. Launch mc_app using AFM connection.
   Don't forget to update simulator server IP and port in debug configuration - 42333.
6. Attach app_process_packet (make sure to un-mark initialization files).
7. After MC reaches main(), run tio console:
   ./bin/tio_console -hub localhost:42975 -ser duart2_1 duart2_0
8. Run mc_app.
   Don't forget to update simulator server IP and port in debug configuration - 42333.
9. Run “tio capture”:
   ./fm_tio_capture -hub localhost:42975 -ser w0_m1 -verbose_level 2
   Here you'll be able to capture sent and received packets.
10. Run “tio inject”:
   ./fm_tio_inject -hub localhost:42975 -ser w0_m1 -file eth_ipv4_udp.pcap -verbose_level 2
   This will send packets to the AIOP.
11. Set break point inside app_process_packet_flow0() and push "Resume / Multi core Resume" button to run and see that
    it's activated on each packet.
12. The packet will also be captured by the tio_capture

===========================================
Possible modifications:
===========================================
1. The user may add application additional initialization inside app_init()
2. The user may add packet processing code inside app_process_packet()
3. The user may use different tio port and update it inside ls2085a_sys_test.cfg
4. The user may use different simulator port
5. The demo runs in MC integrated mode. In order to get back to AIOP standalone
   mode as it was supported in previous releases, it is required to recompile
   aiopsl and app_process_packet project with AIOP_STANDALONE defined.
   Please note that the standalone mode is being phased out and has is no longer verified.
6. The user may run without elf loader. In order to do that go to simulator folder and
   comment the lines marked with "#for elf loader" in cfg files:
   "ls2085a_sys_test" and "ls2085a_sim_init_params"

=================
Important NOTEs:
=================
ARENA SW sets CTSCSR0[CTSEN] and CTSCSR0[NTASKS] by the end of boot,
do not set it inside simulator cfg files

===========================================
ARENA sets the following default values for every NI:
===========================================
  Parser Profile_id = 0 - only parser profile id 0 is supported
  MTU = maximal value
