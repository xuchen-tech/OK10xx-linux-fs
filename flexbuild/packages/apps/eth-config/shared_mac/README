To achieve Shared-MAC functionality in HV2p scenario (Linux-to-Linux),
apply the PCD files in the first partition.

1. Edit /etc/fmc/config/shared_mac/hv2p_config_p4_shared_mac.xml and
make sure the interface is either fm1-gb1 or fm1-gb3 (depending on
the platform).

2. Edit /etc/fmc/config/shared_mac/hv2p_policy_shared_mac.xml and make
sure the MAC address corresponding to 0x210 FQID matches the address of
the shared interface in the first partition (fm1-gb1 or fm1-gb3). Also
make sure the MAC address corresponding to FQID 0x220 matches the
address of the interface eth1 in the second partition.

3. Apply the PCD rules with fmc:
# fmc -c hv2p_config_p4_shared_mac.xml -p hv2p_policy_shared_mac.xml -s
hv2p_swparser_shared_mac.xml -a
